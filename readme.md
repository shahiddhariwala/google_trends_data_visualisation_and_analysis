# Google Trends Data Visualization and Analysis

![Google Trends](google-trends.png)

Welcome to the project "Google Trends Data Visualization and Analysis"! In this project, we will explore the popularity of search terms using Google Trends. By analyzing search volume data, we aim to gain insights into various aspects of the world. Let's dive into the details:

## Project Overview

1. **Bitcoin Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between the search volume for "Bitcoin" and the price of Bitcoin. We'll explore how the popularity of the search term correlates with the cryptocurrency's market performance.

2. **Tesla Stock Analysis**: Explore the connection between the search volume for a hot stock like Tesla and its stock price. We'll analyze whether the search interest in Tesla aligns with the fluctuations in its stock market value.

3. **Unemployment Benefits Study**: Analyze how searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary in relation to the actual unemployment rate in the United States. We'll examine if there is any correlation between search interest and the country's job market conditions.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, you will learn the following concepts and techniques:

- Resampling time-series data to make it comparable by converting it to the same periodicity (e.g., from daily data to monthly data).
- Fine-tuning the styling of charts using various customization options in Matplotlib, such as limits, labels, linestyles, markers, and colors.
- Utilizing grids to visually identify seasonality patterns in time series data.
- Finding missing and NaN values in a DataFrame and working with Locators to enhance the styling of the time axis on a chart.
- Reviewing the concepts learned in the previous days and applying them to new datasets.

## Summary

In this project, we explored the powerful capabilities of Google Trends data for visualizing and analyzing various aspects of the world. By examining the search volume for different terms and their relationships with real-world phenomena, we gained valuable insights into the dynamics of interest and its impact.

Throughout the project, we covered key techniques such as using `.describe()` for descriptive statistics, `.resample()` for changing the periodicity of time-series data, and working with matplotlib.dates Locators to style the timeline. Additionally, we learned how to handle missing values, adjust chart resolution, customize linestyles and markers, and fine-tune chart styling using limits, labels, linewidth, and colors.

Now, let's get started with the exciting journey of exploring and visualizing Google Trends data! Happy coding!
